Here we will analyze each group and see what types of businesses are more favorable.One problem you have when making an investment in something that is profitable is have the knowledge of what I am going to invest in and where to invest. Due to this problem we can use data science to answer these questions and have a better result that when we choose it at random.\n",

The region of the world that we are going to use to analyze the Possible locations is the city of San Francisco in the United States.

    "The first thing we have to do when working with places is first to see the possible regions of the city where to establish a business. We need the geographical positions of preferred areas like latitude and longitude. Get latitudes and longitudes no\n",

    "1. First we get the Geonames data from this [link](https://www.geonames.org/postal-codes/US/CA/075/san-francisco.html). I only get the postal code because latitude and longitude is repeated for different postal codes. To get the closest latitude and longitude I use geocoder, the method I show below.\n",
    "2. Then I get the data from the table with the help of beautifulsoup. In this case I do not have the name of the neighborhood but the postal code.\n",
    "3. We obtain the data in a list. According to the form that the list has, we divide it into two dataframes with pandas.\n",
    "4. We drop the last row of the first dataframe so that it does not contain important information and so that the two dataframes have the same number of rows.\n",
    "5. Then we merge the two dataframes and delete some columns that we don't need.\n",
    "6. We then rename the column names to more familiar names.\n",
    "7. Then we iterate over each row of the dataframe and obtain the latitude and longitude and for each row of the table we obtain the postal code, latitude and longitude in a list.\n",
